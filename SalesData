-- Using SQLiteSudio to query a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

-- To get an idea of the data in each table:

-- When selecting the orderID column to review the data that may need to be cleaned up. 
SELECT * FROM Get_Data.customers;

-- WHERE length(order_id) = 6
-- AND order_id <> 'Order ID'
