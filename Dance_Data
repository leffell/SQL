-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

-- Create a new table within Get_Data database.
CREATE TABLE Get_Data.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

-- See what data is in table after importing the file to input data into the table created. 
SELECT * FROM Get_Data.Spotifydata;

-- Determine the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
Select

Select track_name, artist_name, popularity

-- Using CTE, Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
-- Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, 
-- show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
